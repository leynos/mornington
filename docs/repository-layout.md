# Repository layout

This document describes the generated Mornington repository layout. It
is the canonical reference for where source code, tests, configuration,
automation, and long-lived documentation belong.

## Top-level tree

The tree below shows the generated repository structure. It is intentionally
compact and omits build output such as `target/`.

## Path responsibilities

- `.cargo/config.toml`: Configures Cargo defaults for local development,
  including Linux linker and code-generation settings.
- `.github/dependabot.yml`: Configures automated dependency update checks.
- `.github/workflows/act-validation.yml`: Runs the generated workflow
  validation through `act` separately from main CI.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Runs the generated project's continuous
  integration checks.
- `.github/workflows/mutation-testing.yml`: Runs scheduled mutation testing
  through the shared `mutation-cargo` reusable workflow.

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Builds and publishes binary release
  artefacts for the application flavour.

- `docs/terms-of-reference.md`: Defines the product problem, scope, and
  outcomes.
- `docs/mornington-design.md`: Describes the proposed architecture and
  contracts; its proposed source modules are not an inventory of implemented
  modules.
- `docs/adr-*.md`: Records substantive architecture decisions, beginning with
  the behavioural storage boundary.
- `docs/`: Holds long-lived reference documentation, guides, style rules, and
  design material.
- `docs/contents.md`: Indexes the documentation set and should be updated when
  documentation files are added, renamed, or removed.
- `docs/users-guide.md`: Explains how to use the generated project and its
  public build and test commands.
- `docs/developers-guide.md`: Explains the contributor workflow and local
  tooling used to work on the generated project.

- `docs/polonius.md`: Records the Polonius toolchain contract, borrow-centric
  design guidance, and audited borrow-checker classifications.

- `docs/repository-layout.md`: Documents the repository tree and path
  responsibilities.

- `src/lib.rs`: Contains library support for application logic and doctested
  examples.
- `src/main.rs`: Contains the application entrypoint and top-level executable
  wiring.

- `tests/`: Holds integration and behavioural tests that exercise public
  behaviour.
- `tests/stub.rs`: Keeps the generated test directory valid until real tests
  replace it.
- `AGENTS.md`: Provides repository-specific working instructions for agents and
  contributors.
- `Cargo.toml`: Defines package metadata, dependencies, lint policy, and Cargo
  configuration.
- `LICENSE`: Records the project licence text.
- `Makefile`: Provides the public build, lint, test, coverage, and
  documentation validation commands.
- `README.md`: Introduces the project and gives the shortest useful
  getting-started path.
- `clippy.toml`: Configures Clippy lint behaviour that is not expressed
  directly in `Cargo.toml`.
- `codecov.yml`: Configures coverage reporting behaviour.
- `rust-toolchain.toml`: Pins the Rust toolchain channel and required
  components.

## Ownership boundaries

- Keep generated source code under `src/`. Add modules below `src/` when a
  feature grows beyond a small entrypoint or crate root.
- Keep black-box integration tests and externally observable workflow tests
  under `tests/`.
- Keep reusable documentation under `docs/`. Update `docs/contents.md` whenever
  a documentation file is added, renamed, or removed.
- Keep build and validation entrypoints in `Makefile`; prefer adding or
  extending a Make target over documenting an ad hoc command.
- Keep continuous integration workflow changes under `.github/workflows/` and
  dependency-update policy under `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- Do not commit generated build output such as `target/`, coverage artefacts,
  or local editor state.

## Updating this document

Update this document when the repository gains a new top-level directory, a new
long-lived documentation category, a new workflow file, or a changed ownership
boundary that would otherwise make the tree misleading.
